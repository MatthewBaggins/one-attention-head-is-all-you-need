# One Attention Head Is All You Need for Sorting Fixed-Length Lists

*This work was produced as a part of the [Mechanistic Interpretability Hackathon](https://itch.io/jam/mechint) organized by [Apart Research](https://apartresearch.com). We are grateful to Apart Research for organizing it and for helping with our project.*

We trained some small transformers to sort lists of integers, and analyzed the inner workings of these models. The `notebooks` folder contains the code used to train and test these models, and also to explore the interior. The `models` folder contains the weights for these models after training.
  
## Abstract

We trained some small transformers to sort lists of integers, and analyzed the inner workings of these models. The `notebooks` folder contains the code used to train and test these models, and also to explore the interior. The `models` folder contains the weights for these models after training.
