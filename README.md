## TODO

- All notebooks and stuff
- Save models here
- Writeup, dump pdf here (or link it on AJ site)
  - Remember to fix link to this repo

We trained some small transformers to sort lists of integers, and analyzed the inner workings of these models. The `notebooks` folder contains the code used to train and test these models, and also to explore the interior. The `models` folder contains the weights for these models after training.
